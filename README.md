# AIR DENSITY

##### This project proposes to create inflatable spaces that are generated with a user-interface plugin, one can decide what color each space will be and where to place it on a site. The plug-in focuses on generating spaces using modules, which are then repeated along different paths to create an enclosed room. I decided to go for inflatable architecture due to its physical properties- which work by having air blow into forms made with materials that act like the membrane of a balloon. The reason for an inflatable project is that it can go from 3D to 2D in a matter of seconds and it can travel to many locations.Air Density focuses on providing services to the homeless throughout Los Angeles. It will include a donation center, soup kitchen, health and dental clinics, as well as sleeping modules and restrooms for those who need it temporarily.
